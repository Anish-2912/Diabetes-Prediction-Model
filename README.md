## 🚀 Overview  
This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning models and compare their performances to determine the most accurate classifier. We used **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** to analyze diabetes prediction based on medical data.  

📊 **Best Model:** **SVC (Support Vector Classifier)** achieved the highest accuracy of **76%**.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Comparison of three ML models** (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVC)  
- **Evaluation metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** for model optimization  
- **Data visualization & preprocessing** for better insights  

## 🗂 Dataset  
The dataset used contains multiple features related to diabetes indicators, including glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and other health parameters.
